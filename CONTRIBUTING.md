# Contributing
If you are contributing features, use the develop branch. If you are contributing bugfixes, use the stable branch.

## Code Formatting
Please use standard Java formatting conventions (the default Eclipse formatting profile, but with indented switch cases).
Using statements instead of blocks is fine.
Use tabs for indentation, and asterisks if more than one class is imported from a package.

You may notice this is not followed on the main branch (as of the time of writing - 2023-01-03 - if dev/1.9.0 is merged this will not be the case).
